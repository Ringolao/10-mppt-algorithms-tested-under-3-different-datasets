# 10-mppt-algorithms-tested-under-3-different-datasets
This is a Matlab/Simulink simulation of 10 algorithms (P&O, IncCond, SMC, RCC, FSB, FLC, ANN, PSO, GA, GWO) under 3 datasets: Mid-Latitude, Cloud Transient, and Tropical.

# How to use it:
1. Open all 10 MPPT algorithm matlab files, build_scenarios, analyze_all_results, run_all, metrics_engine, and compute_algorithm_rank_stability. Open pv_environment.slx as well.
2. Run build_scenarios to establish the 3 datasets to create 4 scenarios (clear, ramp, step, and mixed)
3. Run run_all and this will run 120 simulations (10 algorithms x 3 datasets x 4 scenarios). If any existing simulation is done, it will skip to next simulation. This allows users to delete any simulation file they wish to redo and re-simulate only specific simulations.
4. To view results, run metrics_engine and this will visualize the data and also create .csv files of the results.
5. This thesis used a new entropy-weighted metric called algorithm rank stability (ARS) which determines which metric holds more weight in deciding which MPPT algorithsm to use. Run compute_algorithm_rank_stability to visualize the results and also create .csv files of results.

Simulation files are stored in results folder while the results for metrics are in the analysis_results folder.
To delete and re-simulate specific simulations (scenario x algorithm x dataset), go to results folder and delete the simulation files you wish to re-simulate.

A .zip file is in the repository which shows a version of the file with completed results used in the researchers' thesis. When simulating, keep existing folders intact as the code uses these folders to store simulation results.

The document for the study is also attached in this repository (WIP)

# Breakdown of matlab files in the project folder
**build_scenarios.m** - This creates the 4 weather scenarios used in the study (clear, ramp, step, and mixed).

**run_all.m** - Executes the 120 simulations total in the study.

**analyze_all_results.m** - Computes the performance metrics for all the MPPT simulation runs 

**metrics_engine.m** - Compiles all the important data from simulations and create visual graphs and charts of the results.

**compute_algorithm_rank_stability.m** - Computes for the entropy weight derived ranking of the algorithms (Algorithm Rank Stability) which is a unique metric introduced by the study.
